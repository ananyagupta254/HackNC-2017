# HackNC-2017
I worked on a team of seven to design a 3D Virtual Reality (VR) rendering of environments using Unity, Oculus Rift, and C# scripting. We manipulated shapes to construct three different types of 3D graphics to create lifelike environments that simulates the user's physical presence in a virtual world. By participating in HackNC 2017 competition, I learned how to construct 3D graphics and familiarize myself with VR, which is an user-friendly platform to enable users to explore real world scenic designs and historical monuments (like museums) when they would otherwise be unable to.
